<h2>4-Part Project</h2>

Due to the depth of the project, it's been broken down into 4 parts:
<br />

  - üõ†Ô∏è Active Directory Deployment
  - ‚öôÔ∏è DNS Configurations and Management
  - üìà Expansion and Further Management
  - üìú Creating GPO (Group Policies)

<h3>Key Accomplishments:</h3>

1. **Active Directory Deployment:**
   - Set up Azure VMs for Windows Server 2022 and Windows 10.
   - Installed and configured Active Directory Domain Services.
   - Promoted the server to a domain controller and created organisational units.
   - Configured the client VM to join the Active Directory domain and enabled remote desktop access.
   - Implemented and managed a in-depth Active Directory for centralised management of network resources.
   - Set up various Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce security and configuration settings across the network.

2. **DNS Management:**
   - Created and tested A-Records, including updating IP addresses and verifying changes.
   - Set up a CNAME Record to create a domain alias for 'google'.

3. **Troubleshooting and Testing:**
   - Managed DNS settings and cleared cached records to ensure accurate resolution.
   - Verified DNS configuration and connectivity using commands like `ping` and `nslookup`.
  
4. **Group Policy Management:**
   - Created and edited GPOs through the Group Policy Management Console.
   - **Password Policy:** Configured rules for password complexity, length, and expiration to enhance security.
   - **Drive Mapping Preferences:** Automated network drive mappings to ensure consistent access to shared resources.
   - **Desktop Wallpaper Policy:** Set a standardized desktop background to reinforce corporate branding.
   - **Control Panel Policy:** Restricted or customized access to Control Panel settings to prevent unauthorized changes.
   - **Disable USB Devices Policy:** Restricted USB port usage to mitigate security risks.
   - **Account Lockout Policy:** Established measures to lock accounts after failed login attempts to prevent unauthorized access.

This project provided valuable hands-on experience in deploying and managing Active Directory on a Virtual Windows Server 2022 Machine, as well as focusing on DNS management, and creating Group Policy Objects (GPOs).
