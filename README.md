<h2>On-Premise Active Directory using Windows 10 and Windows Server Virtual Machines on Microsoft Azure</h2>
In this project, I successfully deployed an on-premises Active Directory environment using Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines and managed DNS services to improve network functionality.

<h2>3-Part Project</h2>

Due to the depth of the project, it's been broken down into 3 parts:
<br />

  - üõ†Ô∏è Active Directory Deployment
  - ‚öôÔ∏è DNS Configurations and Management
  - üè¢ Simulating Real-Life Business Structure

<br />
This will be found below.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

- <b>Microsoft Azure</b>
- <b>Windows 10 Pro</b>
- <b>Windows Server 2022</b>
- <b>Server Manager</b>
  <b>Azure Virtual Networks</b> 
- <b>DNS Manager</b>
- <b>Command Prompt</b>

<h3>Key Accomplishments:</h3>

1. **Active Directory Deployment:**
   - Set up Azure VMs for Windows Server 2022 and Windows 10.
   - Installed and configured Active Directory Domain Services.
   - Promoted the server to a domain controller and created organisational units.
   - Configured the client VM to join the Active Directory domain and enabled remote desktop access.

2. **DNS Management:**
   - Created and tested A-Records, including updating IP addresses and verifying changes.
   - Set up a CNAME Record to create a domain alias for 'google'.

3. **Troubleshooting and Testing:**
   - Managed DNS settings and cleared cached records to ensure accurate resolution.
   - Verified DNS configuration and connectivity using commands like `ping` and `nslookup`.

This project provided valuable hands-on experience in cloud-based Active Directory and DNS management.
